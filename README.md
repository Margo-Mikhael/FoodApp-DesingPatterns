# Design Patterns Based Food App

**Description**: A Java-based console resturant app implementing various design patterns to solve complex software design challenges and enhance code maintainability.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate the application of various design patterns in solving real-world software design problems. It showcases how design patterns can improve code readability, reusability, and maintainability.

## Design Patterns Implemented

- **Iterator Pattern**:Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Allows adding new functionality to an object without altering its structure.
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary language for implementing design patterns.
- **Other Libraries/Tools**: (Add any relevant tools or libraries you used in the project)
